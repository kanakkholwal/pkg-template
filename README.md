## Dependencies

- [@changesets/cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@changesets/cli): Helps you manage the versioning and changelog entries for your packages, with a focus on versioning within a mono-repository (though we support single-package repositories too).
- [Typescript](https://www.npmjs.com/package/typescript):TypeScript is a language for application-scale JavaScript. TypeScript adds optional types to JavaScript that support tools for large-scale JavaScript applications for any browser, for any host, on any OS. TypeScript compiles to readable, standards-based JavaScript.
- [tsup](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tsup): Bundle your TypeScript library with no config.
